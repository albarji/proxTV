# TODO: things needed to make all this work on all platforms
# -install openblas as dependency (conda install openblas?)
# -install lapack-dev as dependency
# -install lapacke-dev as dependency
# -install gcc, g++, gfortran (build tools) as a dependency OR create a wheel with the preinstalled package??

# If we install with conda openblas, there are issues finding lapacke.h
# If we install with conda openblas + gcc, the install step works until a problem shows up with ld
